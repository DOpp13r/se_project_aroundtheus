## Figma

One of the lessons during this Sprint was the introduction to Figma, a collaborative platform that allows for web-based graphics. It allows for innovative design prototypes to be created and developed. For this project, we were to come up with a way to replicate the project's design through this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1).

## Plans on improving the project

- Cards:

  - like button could change color once it is clicked
  - add a delete button to delete the card from the page

- Profile:
  - 'add' button could have a smooth transition where it enlarges and returns back to normal when the user hovers over
  - edit button could be implemented with an animation
