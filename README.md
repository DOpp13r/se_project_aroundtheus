# Sprint 3: Around The U.S.

Project 3 was an opportunity to create a project from a blank slate by utilizing all the necessary tools and skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This introduction challenged me to create a simple interactive display for a page, modifying the way it may look on multiple types of screens through media queries. As well, the idea of API blended the project all together!

## Figma

One of the lessons during this Sprint was the introduction to Figma, a collaborative platform that allows for web-based graphics. It allows for innovative design prototypes to be created and developed. For the beginning of the project, we were to utilize [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1). It shows the design and breakdown of layouts and styles of page! 

## Plans on improving the project
